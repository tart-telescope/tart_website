This also involves breaking up the huge monolithic TART repository in to smaller and more managable repositories.\\n\\n## Documentation Updates\\n\\n- New jupyter notebooks by Ruby ([tart notebooks](https://github.com/tart-telescope/notebooks)) these notebooks are going to be used in the inaugural TART workshop held at Rhodes.\\n- A new website based on Docosaurus  ([here](https://tart.elec.ac.nz/tart_website/))\\n\\n## Measurement Set updates\\n\\nHuge work by Ben Hugo on making the TART measurement set tools [tart2ms](https://github.com/tart-telescope/tart2ms). These have allowed some fantastic features:\\n\\n* Rephasing of observations into a single measurement set.\\n* Incorporation of Catalogue in JSON into the measurement set.\\n* This allows potentially much more sensitive imaging!\\n\\n## CASA calibration\\n\\nRhodes Calibration with CASA             |  Cal phase vs time\\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\\n![](./rhodes_cal_results.png)  |  ![](./rhodes_gain_vs_t.jpg)\\n\\n## TART workshops progress\\n\\nThree TART workshops are now in various stages of preparation. \\n\\n* Jan 16-17: Breakthrough listen @ Rhodes (Stanley, Ben, Oleg)\\n* Mid 2023: Gabon (Patrice)\\n* Mid 2023: Ghana (Stanley)\\n\\n## TART talks, mentions in media e.t.c\\n\\n* Rhodes opening...
