# The first international TART workshop



## Team Expansion

We've had a good deal of expansion. The TART project has three teams

* Rhodes: Sonia, Ben, Rickus*, Stanley, Oleg, Patrice
* SARAO: Ben, Oleg, Ruby, Nadeem
* Stellenbosch: Rikus, Danie
* New Zealand: Tim, Phill, Max

Rickus (*) gets honourary membership of the Rhodes team for driving from Stellenbosch to Rhodes to help with the installation.

## TART-3 Updates

The NZ team has been hard at work on TART-3. Progress is now accelerating as the radio module is now in early testing. The correlator is the final piece of the puzzle, and is being put together by Pat Suggate - the author of the original TART-2 correlator.

We expect the total number of antennas that can be correlated to be increased to at least 32 in TART-3. The new correlator has the following features

* New SODIMM format FPGA based on Gowin FPGA's which have open source synthesis tools.
* New architecture based on graph optimization.
* Longer visibility integration times - up to a minute -- will be available.

## Rhodes TART comissioning

Gained coverage in the media thanks to excellent organizing by the Rhodes team (Sonia, Rickus (hon), Stanley, Oleg, Patrice). This telescope was a 3-arm interferometer with a new design that allows easy reconfiguration.

## Establishing a new Github home

We began the process of moving the github repositories to a new home (https://github.com/tart-telescope). This also involves breaking up the huge monolithic TART repository in to smaller and more managable repositories.

## Documentation Updates

- A new website based on Docosaurus  ([here](https://tart.elec.ac.nz/doc/)) This website is internationalized into many languages.

## TART talks, mentions in media e.t.c

* Rhodes opening... (see above)
* Sonia: gave a talk to the RATT group
* Patrice: presented to African Astronomical Society (August?)
* Stanley & Tim: Talk in Kenya (8/12/22)
