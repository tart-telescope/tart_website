# Successful TART install in Mauritius

A successful TART installation [workshop](/docs/install/workshop) was held at Université des Mascareignes, on April 14-19 2024. This workshop was sponsored by SARAO, and the local organizing committee was led by Dr Keshav Sewraj. This was the first install of the new spiral antenna concept. Three members of the TART team, Prof Oleg Smirnov, Dr Max Scheel, Dr Nadeem Oozer, travelled to the workshop to help with the install.

We were delighted to find that the array was easily calibrated and has produced excellent images. Here is one below with a bright unknown object at about 40 degrees elevation to the North.
