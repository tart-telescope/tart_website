## TART installations in SKA African Partner nations

During the workshop it was learned that the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO), who host the SKA project in South Africa, will be funding the installation of a TART telescope in many of the SKA African partner nations. These are:
* Botswana
* Ghana
* Kenya
* Madagascar
* Mauritius
* Mozambique
* Namibia
* Zambia

Delegates from each of these partner nations were present at the workshop, along with astronomers from Italy, Portugal, South Africa and further afield.

## The TART logo

We need a logo, and are lucky enough to have a volunteer with a graphics design background to join up! After the logo comes the TART T-shirt. I'd like to make the T-Shirt an annual event.

## Team Expansion

We've had a good deal of expansion. The TART project has three teams

* Rhodes: Ben, Kenda, Rickus*, Stanley, Oleg
* SARAO: Ben, Oleg, Ruby, Nadeem
* Stellenbosch: Rikus, Danie
* New Zealand: Tim, Phill, Max, Pat

Rickus (*) gets honorary membership of the Rhodes team for driving from Stellenbosch to Rhodes to help with the installation.
