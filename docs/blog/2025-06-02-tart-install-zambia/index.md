# Successful TART install in Botswana

A TART installation [workshop](/docs/install/workshop) was held at Copperbelt University (CbU) in Kitwe Zambia on June 2-6 2025. This marks the fourth successful installation of a TART telescope in an SKA African Partner nation, and followed previous installations in [Botswana](/blog/tart-install-botswana), [Mauritius](/blog/tart-install-udm) and [Kenya](/blog/tart-install-kenya) in 2024. The workshop was presented by Prof Oleg Smirnov (Rhodes University, SARAO, South Africa), Dr Tim Molteno (University of Otago, New Zealand) and Dr Ben Hugo (SARAO, South Africa) with the local installation team led by Dr Prospery Simpema of CbU.

The initiative to place TART telescopes in SKA African Partner nations was started in 2023 and is a Joint effort of the [University of Otago](https://www.otago.ac.nz), [Rhodes University](https://www.ru.ac.za), the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory ([SARAO](https://www.sarao.ac.za)), the DARA programme, and the [Electronics Research Foundation](https://www.elec.ac.nz).

The TART-3 electronics have simplified the process of installing the electronics and will also allow the workshop attendees to spend more time engaging with the practical and theoretical aspects of operating a radio telescope. The lecture schedule included two public lectures which were attended by more than a hundred members of the university community and local high school students. After the lectures, there was a fascinating and wide-ranging question and answer session that covered topics from astrophysics in the kitchen to the detection of ghosts with radio telescopes.

The workshop concluded with an Official Opening Ceremony with a presentation from Eng Dr Brilliant Habeenzu, Permanent Secretarty for the Zambian Ministry of Technology and Science.
