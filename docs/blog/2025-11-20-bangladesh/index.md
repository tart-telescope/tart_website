# TART on successfully deployed in Bangladesh

The Center for Astronomy, Space Science and Astrophysics (CASSA) of Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB) held a five-day workshop, titled “Installing a Radio Telescope to Image the Invisible”, to kick off the installation of a Transient Array Radio Telescope (TART), the first instrument of its kind in Bangladesh.

The workshop was held at the CASSA laboratory at IUB, where participants learned about the design and construction of the TART instrument. The workshop was attended by students from more than 10 local Universities, who were introduced to the TART project and its potential applications in astronomy and astrophysics. Students worked on calibration and imaging from the TART and 

The workshop was a huge success, and despite a large earthquake in Dhaka on the last day the workshop, the TART instrument was successfully deployed in Bangladesh. With the final student presentations held the next week on Friday 28 Nov.
