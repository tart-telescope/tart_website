# Contributors to TART codebase

Here is a list of the core contributors to the TART project source code. There are many others who have also contributed in other ways, but in these pages we will highlight some of the most significant contributors. 

## Tim Molteno

Dr Tim Molteno is a Senior Lecturer in Physics at the University of Otago, New Zealand, Senior Research Associate, Physics and Electronics, Rhodes University, South Africa, and Director of the Electronics Research Foundation. He is an expert on Nonlinear Dynamics, Bayesian Inference, Measurement, Electronics, Signal Processing and  Radio Astronomy Instrumentation. Twelve years ago he founded the Transient Array Radio Telescope (TART) project. Tim has contributed code to many many parts of the TART project, his recent contributions include tart-cargo, disko, tart2ms, spotless, the version 3 hardware for the correlator, motherboard and radio-board as well as the current calibration system.



## Max Scheel

Dr Max Scheel  completed his PhD at Otago University on instrumentation & calibration of the first version of the 24-antenna TART (v2.0)  graduating in 2018. During that time Max was responsible for much of the TART imaging and operation code. Since then Max continues to make many contributions to the TART project. He is responsible for the new Web UI, as well as the TART map web application and the cloud storage archive in the AWS compute cloud. Max’s current position is as a platform engineer at  Shuttlerock. Prior to that he worked as a Data Engineer, and before then Software Engineer also at Shuttlerock.

## Pat Suggate

Pat Suggate is an FPGA design specialist who currently works developing hardware and software for embedded vehicle systems. Pat Suggate is the author of the TART correlator code. Pat contributed the first version of the TART correlator HDL, that allows real time correlation of all the TART signals in 2016. Since then Pat continues to develop the next generation TART correlator that, when completed, should allow more antennas, more bandwidth and more sensitivity.


## Ben Hugo

Dr Benjamin Hugo is a staff astronomer with the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) in Cape Town, South Africa. After joining SARAO in 2016 he was involved in telescope commissioning and operations of the 64-dish MeerKAT radio interferometer. His software interests include developing tooling in radio imaging, calibration, simulations and pipelining in support of science operations. His scientific interests are galaxy clusters, and radio polarimetry characterization and ionospheric research. Ben’s contributions to the TART project include a significant part of the tart2ms measurement set creation tool. Ben also has contributed imaging & calibration pipelines.
