# Electronics

The TART Electronics consist of the motherboard, The 24 radio receivers on 6 radio modules, the correlator, the single-board-computer, the power-supply, associated co-ax cables and the enclosure. 

## TART Development Kit

The electronics are available as a development kit, which consists of the current versions of the TART electronic components so the current development kit will change as the community develops new versions of the electronics. The development kit provides a quick way to get started with working on TART telescopes.

Also required for a complete TART are the [antennas](/docs/install/electronics#tart-antennas-and-ground-planes) and the [array hardware](/docs/install/array)

## TART Antennas and Ground Planes

The TART antennas are typically standard GNSS antennas attached to a circular ground plane. The ground plane is circular with a diameter of 135mm, made from 1mm aluminium sheet. If you are developing your antenas locally, then the ground plane size and shape will depend on your choice of antenna design.

A set of 24 antennas and ground planes is also available. These can be purchased locally if required, and the ground planes can be laser-cut from aluminium sheet.
