# Measurement Sets

Share your data to others.

Measurement Sets are a widely used data format for radio astronomy data. The [tart2ms](https://github.com/tart-telescope/tart2ms) tools are used to create measurement sets from TART data.


## Tracking Named Objects

The tart2ms tool can track objects. We have several objects that can be specified. These are

Sun
Moon
Fornax A

| Object       | Description | 
|--------------|-------------|
| Sun          | The sun       |
| Moon         | The earth's moon    | 
| Fornax A     | NGC 1316 (also known as Fornax A) is a lenticular galaxy about 60 million light-years away in the constellation Fornax. It is a radio galaxy and at 1400 MHz is the fourth-brightest radio source in the sky  | 


## Arbitrary Celestial Object Tracking

We use the XXXX coordinate system to specify celestial coordinates... Ben to continue here... You can generate these using the sample code below

```python
import astropy as ap
...
```
