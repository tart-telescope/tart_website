# Terminology 

Here is some TART terminology which we'll try and use consitently in the TART documentation.

* **single-integration** - a single set of visibility measurements consisting of one visibility per baseline.
* **shapshot** - a single set of visibility measurements made at over a short time interval.
* **field** - In a measurement this seems to be a point in the sky which is the phase center of an shapshot? Is field just the name for the phase -center of a shapshot?
* **observation** - a group of snapshots with a common phase center (see rephasing). 
* **rephasing** - the process of creating a new phase center for an observation
* **epoch** - a shapshot?
