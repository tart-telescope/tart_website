# Terminology 

Here is where we define all the tart terminology

* shapshot - a single set of visibility measurements made at one time. For a TART, this has a phase center at the local zenith.
* field - Help! In a measurement this seems to be a point in the sky which is the phase center of an shapshot? Is field just the name for the phase -center of a shapshot?
* observation - a group of snapshots with a common phase center (see rephasing). 
* Rephasing" The process of creating a new phase center for an observation
