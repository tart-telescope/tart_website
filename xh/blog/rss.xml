The team did an amazing job working around flooding in Dubai, as well as flooding in Mauritius, and the telescope was fully operational and making calibrated images on the last day of the workshop -- they did an epic job"</p>
<p>The new array layout is designed to be fabricated on site, with the antennas located on spiral arms at carefully chosen positions that maximize the imaging performance of the TART.</p>

<p>During the workshop it was learned that the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO), who host the SKA project in South Africa, will be funding the installation of a TART telescope in many of the SKA African partner nations. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Botswana</li>
<li>Ghana</li>
<li>Kenya</li>
<li>Madagascar</li>
<li>Mauritius</li>
<li>Mozambique</li>
<li>Namibia</li>
<li>Zambia</li>
</ul>
<p>Delegates from each of these partner nations were present at the workshop, along with astronomers from Italy, Portugal, South Africa and further afield.</p>

<p>We need a logo, and are lucky enough to have a volunteer with a graphics design background to join up! After the logo comes the TART T-shirt. I'd like to make the T-Shirt an annual event.</p>
