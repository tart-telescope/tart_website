What follows is a brief summary of events that took place.\\n\\n\\n## Team Expansion\\n\\nWe\'ve had a good deal of expansion. The TART project has three teams\\n\\n* Rhodes: Sonia, Ben, Rickus*, Stanley, Oleg, Patrice\\n* SARAO: Ben, Oleg, Ruby, Nadeem\\n* Stellenbosch: Rikus, Danie\\n* New Zealand: Tim, Phill, Max\\n\\nRickus (*) gets honourary membership of the Rhodes team for driving from Stellenbosch to Rhodes to help with the installation.\\n\\n## TART-3 Updates\\n\\nThe NZ team has been hard at work on TART-3. Progress is now accelerating as the radio module is now in early testing.\\n\\nTART-3 Radio Module             |  Features \\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\\n![TART-3 Radio Module](./tart3.jpg)  | Two radios per module, PCI-e connector, Easy to replace modules\\n\\n## Rhodes TART comissioning\\n\\nGained coverage in the media thanks to excellent organizing by the Rhodes team (Sonia, Rickus (hon), Stanley, Oleg, Patrice). This telescope was a 3-arm interferometer with a new design that allows easy reconfiguration.\\n\\nThe Rhodes student team             |  Dignitaries\\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\\n![](./opening_ceremony.jpg)  |  ![](./opening_ceremony2.jpg)\\n![Rhodes Opening Newspaper Clip](./TART_Rhodes_news.png)\\n\\n## Establishing a new Github home\\n\\nWe began the process of moving the github repositories to a new home (https://github.com/tart-telescope). This also involves breaking up the huge monolithic TART repository in to smaller and more managable repositories.\\n\\n## Documentation Updates\\n\\n- New jupyter notebooks by Ruby ([tart notebooks](https://github.com/tart-telescope/notebooks)) these notebooks are going to be used in the inaugural TART workshop held at Rhodes.\\n- A new website based on Docosaurus  ([here](https://tart.elec.ac.nz/tart_website/))\\n\\n## Measurement Set updates\\n\\nHuge work by Ben Hugo on making the TART measurement set tools [tart2ms](https://github.com/tart-telescope/tart2ms). These have allowed some fantastic features:\\n\\n* Rephasing of observations into a single measurement set.\\n* Incorporation of Catalogue in JSON into the measurement set.\\n* This allows potentially much more sensitive imaging!\\n\\n## CASA calibration\\n\\nRhodes Calibration with CASA             |  Cal phase vs time\\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\\n![](./rhodes_cal_results.png)  |  ![](./rhodes_gain_vs_t.jpg)\\n\\n## TART workshops progress\\n\\nThree TART workshops are now in various stages of preparation. \\n\\n* Jan 16-17: Breakthrough listen @ Rhodes (Stanley, Ben, Oleg)\\n* Mid 2023: Gabon (Patrice)\\n* Mid 2023: Ghana (Stanley)\\n\\n## TART talks, mentions in media e.t.c\\n\\n* Rhodes opening... (see above)\\n* Sonia: gave a talk to the RATT group\\n* Patrice: presented to African Astronomical Society (August?)\\n* Stanley & Tim: Talk in Kenya (8/12/22)"}]}')}}]);
